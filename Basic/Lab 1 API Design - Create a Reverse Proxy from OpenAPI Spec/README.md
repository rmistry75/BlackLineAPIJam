# API Design : Create a Reverse Proxy from OpenAPI Spec

*Duration : 10 mins* 

*Persona : API Team*

# Use case

You have a requirement to create a reverse proxy for taking HTTP requests from the Internet and forwarding them to an existing backend service. You have decided to follow a design first approach & build a reusable component, a specification which can be used to build API proxies, generate API documentation, and generate API test cases using OpenAPI Specification format. You would like to generate an Apigee API Proxy by using the OpenAPI Specification (Swagger) instead of building the API Proxy from scratch.

# How can Apigee Edge help?

Apigee Edge enables you to quickly expose backend services as APIs. You do this by creating an API proxy that provides a facade for the backend service that you want to expose. Apigee Edge out of the box supports the OpenAPI specification, allowing you to auto-generate API proxies. Apigee Edge also has an OpenAPI specification editor & store which you can use to maintain your OpenAPI specifications. 

The API proxy decouples your backend service implementation from the API that developers consume. This shields developers from future changes to your backend services. As you update backend services, developers, insulated from those changes, can continue to call the API uninterrupted.

In this lab, we will see how to create a reverse proxy that routes inbound requests to existing HTTP backend services using a readily available OpenAPI specification.

# Pre-requisites

Basic understanding of [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (Swagger)

# Instructions

* Go to [https://apigee.com/edge](https://apigee.com/edge) and log in. This is the Edge management UI. 

* Select **Develop → API Proxies** in the side navigation menu

* Click **+Proxy** The Build a Proxy wizard is invoked. 
![image alt text](./media/image_6.png)

* Under **Reverse proxy**, Click on **Use OpenAPI spec** below reverse proxy option.

![image alt text](./media/image_7.png)

* You should see a popup with access to either use a previously imported Open API Spec, upload a new Spec or Import from a URL. Select the **Import from URL** tab. Here, provide the following values:

  * URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmistry75/APIJam/master/Basic/Resources/employee-spec.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmistry75/APIJam/master/Basic/Resources/employee-spec.yaml)
  
  * Spec Name: {Your-Initials} Employee Backend (e.g. RM Employee Backend)

* Click **Import** 

![image alt text](./media/oas.png)

* You should see the "Proxy details" screen as shown below. Leave the default values (unless there is a conflict). Click **Next** to continue.

![image alt text](./media/proxy.jpg)

* You should see the "Policies" screen as shown below.  Leave the default values and click **Next** to continue.

* You should see the "Flows" screen as shown below. Ensure all flows/paths are selected and click **Next**.

![image alt text](./media/image_12.png)

* You should see the "Virtual hosts" screen as shown below. Only choose the secure (https) virtual host and click on **Next**.

![image alt text](./media/image_11.png)

* You should see the "Summary" page as shown below. You are now ready to build and deploy your API proxy.  **Click the "test" environment checkbox and click Create and deploy**.
![image alt text](./media/image_13.png)

* You should see that the proxy has been created and deployed to the test environment as shown below. Click **Edit proxy**.
![image alt text](./media/image_14.png)

* You should see the proxy "Overview" screen as shown below.  In the Deployments section, your URL should look like https://{your-org}-test.apigee.net/{your-initials}-employees-api (where "{your-org}" is your Apigee org name, and "{your-initials}" are your initials) and in the Target Endpoints section your Target URL should be exactly as shown below.

![image alt text](./media/overview.png)

* *Congratulations!* ...You have now built a reverse proxy for an existing backend service.

* You can also edit Open API Specs within Apigee. Click on **Develop > Specs** from side navigation menu.

* You should see your spec in the list.

![image alt text](./media/image_3.png)

* Click on your "{Your Initials} Employee Backend" spec from the list to open the OpenAPI spec editor and interactive documentation that lists the backend API details and resources (as shown below).

![image alt text](./media/image_4.png)

* The host still points to the Apigee Org from which you copied the spec. Update the host with your Org. It should look like {your-org}-test.apigee.net where "{your-org}" is your Apigee org name. We are specifing {your-org}-test because the proxy is deployed in the test environment. If the proxy were deployed on the prod environment, this would change to {your-org}-prod as is shown in the screenshot.

* Update the basePath to "/{your initials}-employees-api", which is the name of the API Proxy we specified earlier.

# Test the API Proxy

* Let us test the newly built API proxy using your favorite API testing tool (e.g. PostMan, curl, or even just your web browser).  

* Copy the URL for your API proxy.  It should be something like https://{your-org}-test.apigee.net/xy-employees-api/employees (where "{your-org}" is your Apigee org name). 

* Paste the URL into your API testing tool or curl and try it (e.g. curl https://{your-org}-test.apigee.net/xy-employees-api/employees)

* You should see a success response (200 OK) with employee data in JSON format.

# Download the API Proxy

* Let’s download the API Proxy locally as an API Bundle so that we can reuse it in other labs.

* Download the API Proxy by downloading the current revision of the proxy. Return to the Overview tab, and see screenshot below for instructions.

# Lab Video

If you like to learn by watching, here is a short video on creating a reverse proxy using an Open API Specification - [https://youtu.be/3XBG9QOUPzg](https://youtu.be/3XBG9QOUPzg) 

# Earn Extra-points

* Now that you have created a reverse proxy using an OpenAPI spec, click on the "Develop" tab and explore the flow conditions populated from the OpenAPI spec. Also, explore the OpenAPI Spec editor where you can edit the OpenAPI specification and test the API requests. Finally, explore the "Trace" tab in the proxy overview page.

# Quiz

1. How do you import the proxy bundle you just downloaded? 
2. How does Apigee Edge handle API versioning? 
3. Are there administrative APIs to create, update and delete API proxies in Apigee?

# Summary

That completes this hands-on lesson. In this simple lab you learned how to create a proxy for an existing backend using an OpenAPI Specification and the Apigee proxy wizard.
